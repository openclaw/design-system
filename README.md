# Carapace

Carapace is the shared visual foundation for OpenClaw public sites and
products: canonical tokens, CSS foundations, and agent guidance.

A carapace is the protective outer shell of a crustacean. The name fits this
project because it gives OpenClaw products a consistent, durable surface while
the applications beneath it keep their own behavior.

The initial contract was extracted from `openclaw/openclaw.ai` at
`b94b43b24f728c902ebb4c09ca3f89aa21e4f1d5` and checked against
`openclaw/clawhub` at `0e898b1dfd309728a031416cd57fa1262af0d064` and
`openclaw/docs` at `2a10e88b244232f9a91d7c9a97f2816297eb2eb4`.
This repository became canonical with `v0.0.1`. The Carapace name and package
begin with `v0.1.0`. Latest tagged release: `v0.1.0`.

## Install

Install an immutable GitHub release without publishing to npm:

```bash
bun add "git+https://github.com/openclaw/carapace.git#v0.1.0"
```

The package is distributed through immutable Git tags rather than npm. Its
`private` package field prevents accidental npm publication; it does not limit
access to this public repository.

Import the complete CSS contract:

```css
@import "@openclaw/carapace";
```

Consumers can instead import focused entry points:

```css
@import "@openclaw/carapace/tokens.css";
@import "@openclaw/carapace/themes.css";
@import "@openclaw/carapace/typography.css";
@import "@openclaw/carapace/base.css";
@import "@openclaw/carapace/components.css";
@import "@openclaw/carapace/themes/product.css";
@import "@openclaw/carapace/candidate/controls.css";
@import "@openclaw/carapace/candidate/feedback.css";
@import "@openclaw/carapace/candidate/data.css";
@import "@openclaw/carapace/candidate/application.css";
@import "@openclaw/carapace/candidate/agent.css";
@import "@openclaw/carapace/compat/clawhub.css";
@import "@openclaw/carapace/tailwind.css";
```

The Tailwind entry point only maps canonical custom properties into Tailwind
4. Applications continue to own their components and product-specific layout.
The product theme and ClawHub compatibility entry points are transitional,
opt-in adapters rather than a second shared visual layer.

`components.css` provides framework-neutral primitives for shared heroes,
section headings, cards, actions, pills, and segmented controls. Consumers keep
their own content and behavior while composing the same visual implementation:

```html
<section class="oc-section">
  <header class="oc-section-header">
    <div class="oc-section-heading">
      <p class="oc-eyebrow">Featured</p>
      <h2 class="oc-section-title">Build with OpenClaw</h2>
      <p class="oc-section-copy">Shared copy and surface styling across products.</p>
    </div>
    <a class="oc-action oc-action-secondary" href="/skills">Browse skills</a>
  </header>
</section>
```

Candidate entry points are additive and opt-in. They are excluded from both
`components.css` and the complete default import until their selectors and
behavior have been validated in multiple consumers. Preview-only Lab work is
not included in package exports.

The candidate application entry point supplies compact navigation, pane,
settings, chat, model-control, session-table, Quick Chat, and status anatomy,
plus split panes, log streams, menu panels, option cards, the command
palette, and collection indicators. The candidate agent entry point owns
approval prompts and transcript anatomy such as tool parameter rows,
payload disclosures, work groups, and compaction markers. Both compose
existing Carapace controls while leaving routes, data, persistence, native
window behavior, and framework state inside each consumer.

OpenClaw surfaces and controls default to a Kumo-aligned radius profile
(`surface`/`control` = `--oc-radius-md` / 8px, `inset` = `--oc-radius-sm` / 4px).
Use the semantic `--oc-radius-surface`, `--oc-radius-control`, and
`--oc-radius-inset` roles instead of choosing from the raw radius scale.
Reserve `--oc-radius-round` for genuinely circular avatars, status dots, and
similar indicators.

## Skills

Install all five project skills from the repository's moving default branch:

```bash
npx skills@1.5.16 add \
  "openclaw/carapace" \
  --skill \
    openclaw-design \
    openclaw-brand \
    openclaw-carapace \
    openclaw-marketing-pages \
    openclaw-design-audit \
  --agent codex \
  --copy \
  --yes
```

Refresh every project skill recorded in `skills-lock.json`, including these
design skills, with the standard updater:

```bash
npx skills@1.5.16 update --project --yes
```

The `openclaw-design` router skill routes work to:

- `openclaw-brand`
- `openclaw-carapace`
- `openclaw-marketing-pages`
- `openclaw-design-audit`

All five skills live in sibling top-level directories so the skills CLI can
discover and update the complete set without repository-specific flags.

## Development

```bash
bun install
bun run check
```

Runtime assets ship under a semantic Git tag and GitHub Release. A release tag
must match the version in `package.json`. Agent guidance follows the repository
default branch so consumer repositories can use the standard skills updater.

Font binaries, logos, mascot artwork, and site-specific media are not included.
Consumers must load licensed assets locally.

## Preview

Run Carapace reference surface locally:

```bash
bun run preview:dev
```

Build the static preview:

```bash
bun run preview:build
```

The Pages workflow publishes the preview at `https://carapace.design/`.
The Applications area contains interactive settings, operations, workspace,
Sessions, and Quick Chat screens with model, state, theme, and viewport
controls.
